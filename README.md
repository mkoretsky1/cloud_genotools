# Cloud GenoTools
GenoTools for Cloud Processing and Prediction (DEPRECATED)

Note: These processes will not be updated for the GenoTools refactor and release. If you would like to use this version of Cloud GenoTools, please pull from the "working" branch in the GenoTools repository (https://github.com/dvitale199/GenoTools). 

Otherwise, please use the --cloud and --cloud_model flags for the pip release of GenoTools to access the GCloud endpoints.
